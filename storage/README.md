# Tusss Storage

I am lazy to remember many things, but I have to manage a lot of them. For instance, personal
equipments, warranty records, etc...

Thus, I came up with an idea to create a local application to store and manage my own stuffs.
Of course, in an over-engineering way.

By building my local app as two directories, one for backend, and one for frontend, I can
simulate a practical application, and experiment the following aspects:

- Domain driven design
- Database schema design
- Admin dashboard construction
- API schema design
